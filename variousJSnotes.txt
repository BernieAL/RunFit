AYSNC & AWAIT

async before a function nmeans the function always returns a promise
await makes JS wait until that promise settles and returns its result

Ex. of a promise that resolves in 1 second

async function f() {
	
	let promise = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
		setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000)
	});

	let result = await promise; //wait until the promise resolves

	alert(result);
}

f();
